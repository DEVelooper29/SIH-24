        <h3>About Leaf Spot</h3>
        <p>Leaf spot is a common term used to describe a number of diseases affecting the foliage of plants. The characteristic symptom is the presence of brown, black, or tan spots on the leaves. The spots may have a yellow halo around them, and if left untreated, they can cause significant damage to the plant, including defoliation and reduced vigor.</p>
